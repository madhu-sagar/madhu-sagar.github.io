title: Humans are Non Polymonial(NP) Machines
---

The idea that humans are NP Machines struck to me the other day. While the idea is hunch based, you can see it happen quite often 
in real life.

The best example is that of seeing a magic performance. While we might not know how the magic was performed and can't probably due
to magic being based on illusion and tricks that humans have bias for due to evolutionary reasons(hence can't figure out how the magic
was performed) but we can verify that we witnessed that something "magical" happened(so can verify the proof in polynomial time).

A less strict version of it is of being amazed by good performances of any kind. Almost every person can instantly tell a good dance performance,
an amazing painting or a very catchy tune from those that are not. Hence differentiating a better composer,artist or a dancer from the
rest.

We are also Polynomial Machines (P as a subset of NP) because they are a few things we figure out or can become better in a few 
endeavours that we devote our lives to. Hence solving some of the problems we face in polynomial time.

Humans are a species known to follow social consensus(Solomon Asch) and by simply copying 
what works, we mimic and imitate the best model of performance we are exposed it(hence the tradition in all the cultures of the 
world where the master/guru/expert/teacher is revered being and given a higher social status and position to guide the disciples
in the arts,crafts and skills).

If you have differing view, please send an email. I would love to correct my hunch and hear a better perspective on this idea.
